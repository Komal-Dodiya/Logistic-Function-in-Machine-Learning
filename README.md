# Logistic-Function-in-Machine-Learning
This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of the Logistic (Sigmoid) Function using Python and NumPy. The logistic function is widely used in machine learning, especially in logistic regression and neural networks, to map input values to probabilities between 0 and 1. Use Sigmoid Function for analysis.
